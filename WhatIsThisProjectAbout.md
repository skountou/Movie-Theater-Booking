# Movie-Theater-Booking
This is a Javascript app, where I created a movie theater UI, holding the seats and a movie screen. The user may pick a movie from a selection of films, and a number of seats!
The app then calculates the sum in USD and present it at the bottom. This project is focued on DOM manipulation and Local Storage techniques.
